## Analysis Goals

1) Identify the Most Popular Products
   
          Analyze the sales data to determine which products are sold in the highest quantities. 
          This insight will help understand customer preferences and drive inventory decisions.

2) Calculate Total Revenue and Sales Quantity by Product Category
   
          Assess the performance of different product categories by calculating the total revenue
          and number of sales for each category. This analysis will highlight the most profitable
          product categories and guide marketing strategies.

3) Identify the Most Commonly Used Payment Method

          Evaluate the various payment methods used by customers and identify the most preferred payment option.
          Understanding customer payment preferences can improve the checkout experience and potentially increase sales.

4) Analyze Regional Sales Patterns

          Investigate the geographic distribution of sales to identify regions with the highest sales volume.
          This information will be valuable for targeted marketing campaigns and regional sales strategies.
